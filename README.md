# Minecraft TypeScript Starter Project Complete (Break the Cotta Game)

This is a completed version of the [../ts-starter/README.md](ts-starter) project.

## Prerequisites

**Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already**

We're going to use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it. (LTS stands for Long Term Support, if you're curious.) In the Node.js Windows installer, accept the installation defaults. You do not need to install any additional tools for Native compilation.

**Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

### Summary

With this starter, you've seen how to build a nice little arena game.

Like the randomly spawning leaves, you can see how you can add different gameplay elements into your arena. Maybe rather than leaves, you want to randomly generate some parkour platforms - or some treasures or weapons, or different types of mobs. Experiment and build your own custom competition arenas!

## Manifest

- [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-scripting-samples/blob/main/ts-starter-complete-cotta/gulpfile.js): This file contains build instructions for the Starter Break the Cotta arena project.
